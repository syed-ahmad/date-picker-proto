### Key Design Considerations for Date Picker

When developing this date picker component, consider:

- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Localization**: Date formats, calendar systems, RTL support
- **Time zones**: Handling UTC vs local time appropriately
- **Range selection**: Support for single dates, date ranges, or multiple dates
- **Constraints**: Min/max dates, disabled dates, allowed date ranges
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Touch-friendly interface, appropriate sizing
- **Framework integration**: How this will integrate with the target framework
